**Adriano Henrique Rossette Leite** is Master of Science in **Electrical Engineering** by Federal University of Itajub√° (**UNIFEI**). His researches involved many robotics and multi-agents systems (MAS/MRS) related application:
- logistics;
- land mines detection;
- human-computer interaction;
- autonomous navigation;
- task allocation (MRTA);
- and their architectures.

using many techniques: 
- image processing;
- control theory;
- artificial intelligence (AI);
- optimization;
- decision making;
- planning;
- and scheduling. 

In March of 2018, he was approved in his Masters dissertation defense. It was named as "*TAlMech*: a Framework for the Development of Multi-Robot Task Allocation Architectures".

He is also Bachelor of Science in **Control and Automation Engineering** by UNIFEI. At his Graduation Commencement, in the end of 2015, he was awarded the Control and Automation Engineering Student of the Year. The main activities during his graduation were: 
- subject monitor;
- scientific initiation researcher;
- Expertinos Autonomous Robotics Team member;
- as well as, scholar in the Science without Borders (CsF) [program](/csf/), studying at Tennessee Technological University (**TnTech**) in United States of America (USA), sponsored by the Brazilian government (CAPES).

Concurrently with his Masters program, he developed researches as a member of the Group of research in Automation and Information Technology (GATI) which belongs to the System Engineering and Information Technology Institute (IESTI) at UNIFEI. 

In addition, as an Expertinos Team member, he represented UNIFEI in Brazilian and international autonomous systems competitions and challenges.
