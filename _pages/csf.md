I went to United States of America (USA) as an undergraduate student with a Capes' scholarship in the Science without Borders (CsF) program at the Tennessee Technological University (TnTech). 

Firstly, I was enrolled in a Foreign Language School (FLS) to improve my English speaking, reading, writing and listening skills in order to achieve at least the minimum proficiency level required by the hosting university. Two months later, I was certificated by FLS and so able to attend the TnTech classes.

As a FLS student, I met students from Asian, European and Latin American countries. Thus, this was not only an experience with the American culture, but also with other ones. Besides that, I got actively involved wih the local Baptist church where I could meet several American people. Fortunately, this opportunity was even richer than I expected.

In August, after the English course, I became a Computer Engineering student at TnTech. My main academic experiences there were related to (1) manipulator robotics; (2) software development; (3) control system analysis and design; as well as, (4) industrial automation. In each subject I could use high tech laboratories and go through lectures and debates, work presentations, and group works.

This opportunity abroad also gave me chance to grow as a person by living own my on and facing daily events. Moreover, I bought a car to travel across multiple states in USA with my friends, going from Cookeville towards San Francisco. During this trip, I had to be responsible to drive and to write down all our common expenses. 

To sum up, during my exchange program, I became more confident and my English, academic, professional and social habilities got better. In addition, I have been at several American biomes, landscape, national parks, cities and states. Despite the fact that this abroad experience delayed one year in my graduation program here in Brazil, it gave me lots of incredible life experience years. It was worthy indeed!
